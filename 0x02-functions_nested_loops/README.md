This readme contains the various codes in c for the nested loops task in the alx software engineering programme.
There was a clickable link to the content of the _putchar to be used_

17th August, 2022; README Update
The advanced tasks of the task 14 until end were done weeks later when I had a clearer understanding of how nested loops works, should you be challenged by this task, know that you just need a better understanding of how things work.
