More tasks solved using nested loops when possible.
edit 1 - encountered an error with the checker, where only  check zero is passed
so this edit is to update my README for troubleshooting.
edit 2 - error resulted from my main.h file, i have to push it everytime i add a new file.
this was not a problem previously because i added all the prototypes to be used at once to the main.h file.
forgot to do that this time, so error resolved, checker never wrong as usual?
